# STA304-Final-Project
The dataset is downloaded directly in file "STA304_Final_Project_1002898340.Rmd" from this website: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/. So there is no data files uploaded. 

The data cleaning process is included in STA304_Final_Project_1002898340.Rmd, so there is no other .R script for cleaning the data.
